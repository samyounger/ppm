    <h2>About</h2>
<p>We are a low profile, non-sales driven business which is centred upon putting our client’s needs first and providing a first class service at all times. Our primary service is Discretionary Portfolio Management which we provide for personal investments as well as assets held within Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and Trusts. With over 30 years in business, our approach hasn’t changed, our clients will always remain at the heart of our business. Testimony to that is the fact that a large proportion of our clients have been with us for many years.</p>

<h2>Our Services</h2>
<p>The services that we provide are focused entirely on the management of investment portfolios. The portfolios are mainly held by the clients’ personally, within a SIPP or via a Trust; almost all are managed with a discretionary mandate whereby we have the client’s authority to transact investments on their behalf without reference to the client. We supplement the investment management function with financial advice that is relevant to the management of the client’s portfolio. Such advice is only provided to those clients whose portfolios we manage.  We do not provide a holistic financial planning service nor do we provide advice on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p>Our services are tailored to meet your individual needs. Before any work is undertaken on your behalf, the services we will provide to you and the cost of those services are agreed with you.  These are subsequently set out within a Management Agreement which will include the terms and conditions relating to our services.</p>
<p>We offer six investment portfolio structures, five graded according to risk plus a specialist portfolio geared towards providing income. We undertake the management of portfolios on both a fully bespoke basis and also model portfolios that represent a collection of ‘best ideas’. Clients who opt for a fully bespoke mandate receive a comprehensive actively managed service which can access a full range of asset classes, including (where appropriate) individual shares.</p>
<p>Our Model Portfolio proposition aims to generate consistent, risk-adjusted returns from our offering of risk graded portfolios which encapsulate our research-led, diversified selection of preferred collective investments. The Model Portfolios are reviewed, taking into account quantitative and qualitative measures, on a regular basis.</p>

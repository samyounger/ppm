    <h2>Portfolio management</h2>
<p>We use the following process to manage your portfolio:</p>
<p>Attitude to investment risk and capacity for loss is established and regularly reviewed</p>
<p>Asset allocation model is constructed based on attitude to risk and investment time horizon</p>
<p>Portfolio constructed is based on your individual circumstances, attitude to risk and your investing circumstances</p>
<p>Investments we select are approved by our in-house investment committee after extensive research</p>
<p>The investment strategy is reviewed regularly in order to ensure your risk preference and investment objectives are met</p>

<h2>Portfolio Strategies</h2>
<h4>Cautions</h4>
<p>A portfolio designed for those wishing to take a lower risk approach. The underlying assets offer the potential to provide a better total return over the long term than is likely to be achieved from a cash deposit account. Although the investments held within the portfolio are likely to fluctuate in value, security of capital will be the priority and it is expected that the level of volatility will be relatively low.</p>
<h4>Moderate</h4>
<p>Whilst the principle of capital preservation will still be a factor in asset allocation the Moderate Portfolio accommodates a higher proportion of assets where the capital value will vary according to market conditions. For example, there will be a greater exposure to equities although the proportion of the portfolio invested in equity only funds will not exceed 50%.</p>
<h4>Balanced</h4>
<p>A portfolio which aims to strike a reasonable compromise between risk and reward. This is achieved by managing a selection of investments with different risk ratings which, when combined, will produce an overall medium risk approach. As this portfolio is likely, at times, to have a significant exposure to equities, it will be liable to greater fluctuations in value compared to the Cautious and Moderate Portfolios.</p>
<h4>Growth</h4>
<p>A portfolio which adopts a higher risk strategy in pursuit of capital growth (where income is of secondary importance), primarily through investment in equity related assets. In pursuing higher levels of capital return, the possibility of incurring a capital loss is also increased. In adopting this strategy, the investor would have to accept the additional risk involved and the likelihood of higher volatility.</p>
<h4>Unrestricted</h4>
<p>A portfolio for the more experienced investor, who is prepared to take very high risks by investing in assets that have the potential for substantial gain, but also have the capacity for substantial loss. The portfolio will consist of individual equity holdings and other equity related assets which provide exposure to large, mid and small cap equities. Your attitude to investment risk and capacity for loss will have determined the suitability of these investments, and the level of exposure to them within your portfolio. You accept the increased risk associated with this portfolio, presented by both the lower level of diversification and a likely higher level of volatility.</p>
<h4>Income</h4>
<p>A portfolio designed for clients who require a high level of dividend and/or interest income to be paid out on a regular basis. Capital growth is of secondary importance. Income portfolios will invest in equity income funds, corporate, strategic and high yield bonds, commercial property funds, individual equities (subject to risk appetite) and other stock market related products that aim to generate a high income.</p>

<h3>Understanding investment risk</h3>
<p>Risk and reward are inextricably linked and therefore the appropriate risk/reward balance has to be agreed at the outset before embarking on the management of your portfolio. All investments carry some degree of risk, with the general rule of thumb being the higher the risk the higher the potential gain or loss. To understand the relationship completely you must establish where your comfort level is with regard to your attitude to investment risk and capacity for loss.</p>

<h4>Attitude to investment risk</h4>
<p>This refers to the psychological aspect when you invest and reflects your willingness to accept that your investments can fall in value as well as rise. Your comfort level with risk should pass the 'good night's sleep' test, which means that you should not worry about the amount of risk in your portfolio so much as to lose sleep over it.</p>

<h4>Capacity for loss</h4>
<p>This is largely dictated by your own circumstances and is essentially the level at which you would be financially able to withstand losses within your portfolio. If you have a high degree of wealth, and can invest over a longer time horizon then you may be willing to accommodate a higher degree of risk within your portfolio.</p>

<h4>Risk appetite</h4>
<p>There is no right or wrong amount of risk-it is very much a personal decision for each investor. However, younger investors can typically accommodate higher risk than older investors can, as younger inverstors have more time to recover if their investments fall in value.If you are five years away from retirement, you probably don't want to be taking extraordinary risks with your investments, because you will have little time left to recover from any potential significant loss.</p>

<p>Investing in the shares or bonds of individual companies exposes investors to both company specific (unsystematic) and stock market (systematic) risk. Investing in shares and/or bonds via a Collective Investment Scheme (e.g. Open Ended Investment Company (OEIC) or Investment Trust) that provides exposure to a broad spread of securities seeks to eliminate the greater of these two risks i.e. individual company risk. For this reason, our favoured approach in managing your portfolio is to place emphasis on Collective Investment Schemes rather than individual shares.</p>

<p>However, we also recognise that investing in individual shares can undoubtedly offer the potential for higher returns and we can also incorporate this into the management of your portfolio. In adopting this approach investors have to be aware of the increased risk presented by the lower level of diversification, likely higher level of volatility and increased risk to their capital versus a portfolio of collectives (funds). A successful compromise can often be achieved by adopting a hybrid approach to the management of portfolios where collectives form the larger core element of portfolio construction and a selection of individual shares comprise the smaller, higher risk/reward component.</p>

<p>Risk is also a function of time and therefore, in setting up and managing a portfolio, your time horizon for investment is an important factor. As a general rule we do not set up discretionary portfolios for clients whose intention is to invest for a period of less than 5 years.</p>

<p>The value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up and you may not get back the amount invested.</p>
